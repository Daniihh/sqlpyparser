sqlpyparser
===========
sqlpyparser is a continuation of [seporaitis' mysqlparse](https://github.com/seporaitis/mysqlparse). More information coming soon. Use at your own risk.

Goal
====
The goal of seporaitis' original project was to make a MySQL syntax parser, out of frustraition for lack of a better tool. [Daniihh](https://github.com/Daniihh)'s new goal for the project is quite the same; make a general SQL parser, out of frustraition for lack of a better tool, and frustraition that the very same developers who created this project back in 2016 cut the project short. Daniihh still respects the contributors of the old repositories work.
In respect of the old project, the MIT license will stay constant. Any requests made by the original repository owner regarding this repository Daniihh will abide.
